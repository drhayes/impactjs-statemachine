# impactjs-statemachine

Provide a state machine implementation for use in ImpactJS games through one class, `StateMachine`.

## Overview

Sometimes you have to pull out the big guns.

If you have sections of your entity code that are tangles of if-then-else, you might need a state machine. State machines are great for:

* **AI**. Enemies can get into an aggro state if the player attacks them but should "cool down" after five seconds.
* **Animation**. The player entity should only play the `crouching` animation once, and then should show the `crouched` animation.

## Usage

Instantiate a state machine:

```js
var sm = new StateMachine();
```

Add states:

```js
sm.state('foo', {
  update: function() { console.log('foo'); }
});

sm.state('bar', {
  update: function() { console.log('bar'); }
});
```

Call in update:

```js
sm.update();
```

### StateMachine

#### `state`

```js
state('stateName', {})
state('stateName')
```

Two forms: first adds a new state by that name to the state machine. Second retrieves the state's definition for that name, if any.

The first state added will be the `initialState` when the state machine starts running.

##### State definition

```js
{
  enter: function() {},
  update: function() {},
  exit: function()
}
```

All optional. `enter` called when state is transitioned to, `update` on every cycle of the state machine, `exit` before the state is transitioned out of.

All methods are called within the context of the state machine instance; any properties set on the state machine instance will be available as properties on `this` within the methods.

#### `transition`

```js
transition('transitionName', 'fromStateName', 'toStateName', function() {})
transition('transitionName')
```

Define a transition between two states with the given name. Retrieve the named transition.

The transition method should return `true` if the transition should be taken. Transition checking will short-circuit if one transition returns true.

#### `update`

Call this every frame, possibly in an entity's `update` method.

If this is a new state, then the state's `enter` function will be called. The `update` method of the state will be called next. If any of the transitions' predicates return `true` then the current state's `exit` method will be called and the new state will be `enter`ed on the next call to `update`.
